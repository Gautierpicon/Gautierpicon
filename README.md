## 🚀 About Me
I am a 🇫🇷French high school student aged 16. I'm particularly interested in marketing, human psychology, how social networks work, open-source, personal data management by GAFAM, Linux, interface design and computer science.

In code, I'm mainly learning the frontend in order to improve my web development skills.

## 🛠 Skills
I know Html, Css and the basics of JavaScript. I'm currently deepening my knowledge of the Astro and React frameworks. And I'd like to learn VueJs and GoLang in the future.

## ⭐️ Other Things About Me
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on my protfolio

🧠 I'm currently learning React and React Native through Expo 

👯‍♀️ I would like to do some work experience in France to improve my skills and learn to work in a team. 

🤔 Don't hesitate to contact me if you find bugs or areas for improvement on my works ( in my portfolio for example). 

📫 You can reach me with my email adress or my twitter account ( link down below )

⚡️ I really hate JavaScript, what an horrible language 😭
